 * Service will provide the requested content by either querying it directly to

 * Cache lifetime is indefinite (for now at least) since content is not likely
 * to change. Although cache may be deleted if there is at least one shopping
 * cart referencing the cache data.
 *
 * Cache is actually composed by other MongoDB collections for each entity
 * (album, artist, ...) but it's called cache because it temporarily saves data
 * from previous requests
 *
 * NOTE: A more professional way to do all this is by simply using GraphQL
 * federation or some kind of gateway but... this is a mock appðŸ˜…ðŸ˜œ...
